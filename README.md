This project LSTM is used ,which is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is widely used for text spam detection. It excels at capturing sequential patterns in text, which allows it to effectively analyze and remember word dependencies. They process textual data in a way that learns and extracts relevant features, making them useful for detecting patterns that indicate spam or malicious content. The LSTM's ability to handle different lengths of text and capture nuanced linguistic relationships helps it perform better in text spam detection tasks.
